      <p> Everyone is called to holiness, according to Catholic doctrine. This implies that each of us is called to a life of spiritual development that involves increasing our relationship with God and emulating Christ. The Catholic Church's teachings can be a true method to develop in grace and get closer to God, even if there are numerous ways to holiness.</p>
      <br> The doctrines of the Catholic Church are derived from those of Jesus Christ as preserved in the Scriptures and preserved through Church tradition. These teachings encompass a wide range of subjects, including social justice, morality, and the sacraments as well as prayer. Catholics can develop their knowledge of God's will and become more completely the people He made them to be by adhering to these principles.</br>
      <br>The following are some specific ways that someone can achieve holiness by faithfully implementing Catholic Church teachings:</br>
      <br>First of all, Growing in holiness requires us to incorporate the teachings of the Catholic Church, read the Bible, and apply our faith in real life. We can develop into the best versions of ourselves and contribute to creating a more equitable and loving world by making an effort to be more conscious of our impact on the environment, practicing humility and compassion, serving others, and strengthening our relationship with God. Holiness can be a long journey; it cannot be attained in a single day, month, or year. Expect that attaining it was a difficult path to walk through and expect a bumpy road as it is filled with challenges. We need to overcome our own weaknesses with the help of God and the saints in order to be holy. </br>
      <br>Secondly, One way to attain holiness is by praying daily as St. John Chrysostom said “It is simply impossible to lead, without the aid of prayer, a virtuous life.” It's crucial to approach prayer with a sincere and humble attitude, realizing one's own limitations and shortcomings and seeking guidance and inspiration from God. A greater relationship with God should be fostered by being consistent in prayer and allocating regular time each day for this purpose. Remember that daily prayer is a personal journey, and what works for one person may not work for another. Keep an open mind and heart, be patient with yourself, and trust that your daily prayer practice will lead you towards greater holiness and spiritual growth. </br>
      <br>Thirdly, Maintain your relationship with the Church: For individuals attempting to live a holy life, the Church is a very helpful source of support and direction. Regularly attend Mass, partake in the sacraments, and seek guidance from the pastor or other spiritual leaders for advice. Always keep in mind that developing a connection with the church is a lifelong endeavor that calls for endurance, dedication, and an open heart. You can become more holy and get closer to God by making an effort to get involved in your community and develop your spiritual life.</br>
      <br>Fourthly, Seek reconciliation: Leading a holy life involves many different facets, including forgiveness and reconciliation. Be willing to forgive individuals who have wronged you and to ask forgiveness from those you have hurt. Seeking reconciliation is a never-ending process that necessitates patience, humility, and a willingness to learn and grow. We can achieve greater holiness and draw closer to God by making amends with others, forgiving those who have hurt us, and working toward greater unity and harmony in our relationships. </br>
      <br>Lastly, Learn from the next-door saint: Learning from the next-door saints can be a powerful way to grow in holiness. In "Gaudete et Exsultate," Pope Francis uses several saints as illustrations of holy people who have gone before us. Examine their lives and take inspiration from them. Try to follow their example and apply their wisdom to your own life. Lastly, study their teachings and way of life. Read the saint's biographies, letters, and other writings. Consider how you can apply their teachings to your own spiritual path and look for themes that are applicable to your own life.</br>
      <br>In conclusion, achieving holiness is a lifelong journey that necessitates a dedication to prayer, sacraments, virtues,service, and the study of Church teachings. We can draw closer to God and become the person God created them to be by faithfully implementing these teachings.</br>
