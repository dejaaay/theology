    <p>We, the people living here on the earth, tend to wander and move on without certain directions, and we tend to do the “go with the flow” mentality. Well not all but most of us because some of us live and do their life with purpose, they know what to do and for everyone of us, we all know that this is the right thing to do. But what is really the right thing to do? Have you asked that to yourself before? What is the right thing to do in the eyes of the Lord. Do we have to follow certain rules or things? Well based on the bible, Jesus lived a perfect, sinless, holy and blameless life in the form of man's flesh. This is the example of holiness we are to follow. We are to be holy, even as He is holy. So how can we attain that? How can we cultivate holiness? </p>
    <p>A strong commitment to Catholic Church doctrines is necessary for leading a life of holiness and fidelity. We are urged to live out a spirit of stewardship, joy, community, justice, and discipleship through the papal writings Laudato Si, Gaudete et Exsultate, and Christus Vivit.</p>
    </div>

          <div class="img">

          </div>
          <div class="text0">
            <p>First, Gaudete et Exsultate emphasizes that we are supposed to exemplify joy and holiness. To do this, we must cultivate an attitude of thankfulness, behave with love and compassion toward others, and strengthen our connection with God by participating in prayer and the sacraments. We believe that the very first step to attain holiness should come from ourselves first, and practicing kindness and compassion is a very important foundation in this.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="event1">
          <div class="text1">
            <p>Second, For a life of holiness, maintaining a loyal community is essential. We must actively participate in our parish, promoting a culture of encounter and community, as stated in Christus Vivit. This entails giving back to the community, interacting with other Catholics, and supporting initiatives that advance harmony and cooperation within the Church. After we improve ourselves, we must improve our souls as well, nurture our relationship with our God, and nurturing the faith will be the great opportunity for the next steps.

          </div>
          <div class="text2">
            <p>Third, we are called to embrace missionary discipleship, as emphasized in Christus Vivit. This entails proclaiming the Good News of the Gospel to people, being proactive in evangelization, looking for chances to discuss our faith, and supporting global initiatives to do so. Remember that all of us are the likely image of God so we must treat others fairly or how we treat ourselves. If we have already accomplished the two steps above then that is much better because we can definitely treat others with respect and equally.

        <div class="event1">
          <div class="text3">
            <p>Fourth, promoting social justice is a central teaching in both Laudato Si and Gaudete et Exsultate. Through supporting charities that help the less fortunate, educating people about social justice concerns, and fighting for laws that uphold the rights and dignity of everyone, we can and must defend the rights and dignity of the poor and vulnerable. After we fix ourselves, we must stand with the others, especially the oppressed and poor ones. We must never exclude them. Never.

        </div>
        <div class="text4">
            <p>And last but not least, practicing environmental stewardship is a key teaching in Laudato Si. This includes taking conscious steps to reduce our carbon footprint, conserving energy and water, and promoting policies that support sustainability. We must also recognize the sacredness of the environment as a gift from God and act accordingly. After all, we are all stewards of God’s creation and we must never forget that and we have a responsibility to take care of it.
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>It takes a constant dedication to conversion and growth to live out Catholic teachings. We must be obedient to the direction of the Holy Spirit and allow God's grace to change us. This continuing conversion process is not always simple, and it calls for humility and a readiness to acknowledge our mistakes. Yet by accepting this ongoing conversion process, we may develop in holiness and improve as Christ's disciples.
        </p>
        <p>In order to integrate these teachings into our lives, we must also seek God's guidance and strength. This means being intentional about our prayer life and seeking to deepen our relationship with God through the sacraments. By relying on God's grace, we can overcome our weaknesses and be empowered to live out the teachings of the Catholic Church in our daily lives.</p>
        <p>In the end, if we want to live a life of holiness and faithfulness, we need to be grounded in the Catholic Church's teachings and strive to imitate Christ in everything we do. We may build a life of profound spiritual fulfillment and purpose by making a commitment to continuing conversion and progress.</p>
